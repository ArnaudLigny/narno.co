# cecil.link

> _cecil.link_ is an URL manager (and shortener) powered by [Cecil](https://cecil.app) (a static site generator).

## How does it work?

_cecil.link_ is files based, so it nead a file to handle the redirection from the `slug` to the target URL.

So you just have to create this file then _cecil.link_ does the rest of the job.

_cecil.link_ creates:

1. an HTML file for each URL including the [HTML redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections)
2. a [Netlify Redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/) file
3. an Apache `.htaccess` file

## Usage

### Create an URL

To create a new URL just create a Markdown file in the `content/` directory, with a `redirect` variable stored in the front matter.

#### Example

File name: `ggl.md`

File content:

```yaml
---
redirect: https://www.google.com/search?q=cecil+static
---
```

Demo: https://cecil.link/ggl
